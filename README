THIS IS AN ZIG 0.13.0 PROJECT. THERE IS NO PLAN TO UPGRADE TO ZIG 0.14.0 SINCE IT REMOVED std.rand!

How to build:

	zig build --release=fast

How to use:
	
	/path/to/binary [count]

How to release manually:

	./build

I'm tired to make a github action to do this. I can do this manually.

This thing is so dumb that I won't maintain it only if I need to add more syllables.
